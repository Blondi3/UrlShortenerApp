Included I have the UrlShortenerApp and the UrlShortenerAppFixed:

UrlShortenerApp:
This is the app I managed to create within the 2-3h time span, it can successfully shorten a Url, but is unable to display the shortened url and save it to a sqlite db,
so the ViewPastUrlsPage page does not work.

UrlShortenerAppFixed:
This is the continuation past the deadline into a completed product, this took about an hour to achieve, what I did to make the application functional is:

*Improved MVVM
*Add missing dependencies which is why the sqlite db would not save
*Fix ui display logic
*Add 2 missing OnPropertyChanged events
*Change the Ribbon colour so that the back button is visible

I used a website named "rebrandly.com" unfortunately this website only provides 10 (9 left) uses of their Url shortening services for free uses, so I created a burner account:
Username: gesowa8676@hisotyr.com
Password: MiethkeMeeting01

I also added dummy code, if you run out of free uses and would like to uncomment it and test the application without having to.
